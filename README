django-webstats
===============================================================================
A django based tool for monitoring website visitor activity.
It works by including a small piece of html that requests a 1 pixel transparent image into each website page to be monitored.

e.g. <img src="http://server:8000/webstats/track/" where 'server' is the 
host running the django_webstats instance.
